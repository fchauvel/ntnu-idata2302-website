This module focuses on *graphs*: Webs of nodes connected by
links. Graph is a versatile concept that surfaces is every application
domain, from transportation to Biology: Social networks, food webs,
digital circuits, transportation maps, etc. We sill look at how to
represent graphs in memory, how to traverse them, and more.

   Here we only scratched the surface, from the Computer Science
   angle. Graph is such a common construct that it has its dedicated
   bra of mathematics! There are many resources available to go

     edition, Springer.
