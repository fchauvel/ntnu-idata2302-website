   answers. Here are some guidelines:
   
   - Justify your answers, especially calculations.
   - Do *not* exceed *8 pages*
   - Do *not* attach a zip of your Java project

   Submit your report, as a **PDF** file, on Blackboard by **Friday
   September 20, 2024 at 23:30** at the latest. You will find the
   submission form under `Learning material 〉Sequences 〉Lab 2`.

   Note that you need to be assigned in a group to see the submission
   form.


Sequences Using Arrays in Java
==============================

This first section focuses on how to implement the Sequence ADT using
*arrays* in Java (see lectures :doc:`2.2 </sequences/arrays>` and
:doc:`2.3 </sequences/dynamic_arrays>`).

The class :code:`no.ntnu.idata2302.lab02.SequenceTest` contains some
unit tests that might help you.

.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/insertion
   :nonumber:

   Implement the `insert` function, which inserts the given item at
   the given position. If the underlying array is full, it shall
   resize the array appropriately, by doubling its capacity.
           
   .. code-block:: java

      public void insert(int item, int index) {
        // TODO: Implement
        throw new RuntimeException("Not yet implemented.");
      }

.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/deletion
   :nonumber:

   Implement the `remove` function, which delete the item stored at
   the given index. If the underlying array gets empty, it shall
   resize the array appropriately. It should halve the capacity as soon
   as the load is less or equal than 25 %.
           
   .. code-block:: java

      public void remove(int index) {
          // TODO: Implement
          throw new RuntimeException("Not yet implemented.");
      }
   
.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/search
   :nonumber:

   Implement the `search` function, which returns an index where the
   given item can be found, or `0` if the sequence does not include
   that item.
           
   .. code-block:: java

      public int search(int item) {
        // TODO: Implement
        throw new RuntimeException("Not yet implemented.");
      }

Finding Extrema
===============

We focus here on finding extrema, that is, both the minimum and the
maximum of the sequence.

.. exercise:: 3 points
   :label: lab/sequences/extrema/code
   :nonumber:

   Propose an algorithm the finds both the minimum and the maximum of
   the sequence.

   .. code-block:: java

      public int[] extrema() {
        // TODO: Implement
        throw new RuntimeException("Not yet implemented.");
      }

.. exercise:: 1 point
   :label: lab/sequences/extrema/worst-case
   :nonumber:

   What is the worst-case scenario for your algorithm? Give an sample
   sequence that triggers that worst case.

.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/extrema/worst-case/count
   :nonumber:

   Given a sequence of length :math:`\ell`, how many comparisons are
   needed in the worst case. Express it as a function of :math:`\ell`.
              

Finding Duplicates
==================

.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/duplicate/code
   :nonumber:

   Propose an algorithm that checks whether the given sequence has
   duplicates, that is, whether any item occurs more than
   once. Consider the following examples:

   - The sequence :math:`s_1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)` does not contain any
     duplicate.

   - The sequence :math:`s_2 = (2, 1, 3, 3, 5)` contains one
     duplicate, 3, which occurs twice.

   - The sequence :math:`s_3 = (1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4)` also contains one
     duplicate, 1, which occurs three times.

   Do **not** use any additional data structures, such as hash tables,
   hash sets, etc.

   We can add it has a new operations on our Sequence class, as
   follows:

   .. code-block:: java

      public boolean hasDuplicate() {
        // TODO: Implement
        throw new RuntimeException("Not yet implemented.");
      }
      
.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/duplicate/worst-case
   :nonumber:

   What is the worst-case scenario for this algorithm? Given a
   sequence of length :math:`\ell`, how many comparisons does this
   worst-case requires? Express it a function of :math:`\ell`.

   
.. exercise:: 3 points
   :label: lab/sequences/duplicate/worst-case/big-oh
   :nonumber:

   Consider the following growth orders:

   .. hlist::
      :columns: 4

      - :math:`g(x) = 10`
      - :math:`g(x) = \log_2 x`
      - :math:`g(x) = \sqrt x`
      - :math:`g(x) = x`
      - :math:`g(x) = x^2`
      - :math:`g(x) = 2^x`
      - :math:`g(x) = x!`
   
   #. Which one(s) are valid upper bounds for the function you found
      the previous question?
   #. How would you express such an upper bound with the Big-Oh notation?
   #. Which one is the tightest bound?

      
Digital Counter
===============

Consider a counter whose value increases whenever the user presses the
"increment" button. The user can read the value on a sequence of
`single-digit displays
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display>`_, where each
display only shows a single symbol (from 0 to 9).

Each single-digit display accepts a `next` command that changes it to
the next symbols, for instance, from 0 to 1, from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, etc,
and from 9 back to 0.

.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/counter/algo
   :nonumber:

   Implement the `increment` function, that increases the counter
   value by one.

   .. code-block:: java

      public class Counter {

         private DigitDisplay digits[];

         public void increment() {
            // TODO: Implement, by calling digits[i].next() when appropriate
         }

      }

      class DigitDisplay {
         // ...
      }
   
   Note that, in some cases, we must propagate the carry to the
   left. For instance to increment `123`, only the right-most digit
   change to make `124`, but incrementing `199` yields `200` and three
   digits must changed.

.. exercise:: 2 points
   :label: lab/sequences/counter/amortized
   :nonumber:

   When incrementing the value of the counter, how many times does
   your algorithm invoke the `next` operation for its digits. Use
   amortized analysis to find a bound.
